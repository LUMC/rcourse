title: "BAST R Course"
---
Due to COVID-19 we have deviated from our regular [live interactive course](https://barmsijs.lumc.nl/R_course/) by  compiling an exsiting on-line video tutorial covering the following objectives: 

- master the basics of R in RStudio
- manipulate data
- visualize data and (intermediate) results
- produce reproducible reports using R markdown

To complete the course you will follow the video tutorials from the [schedule]() on [https://...](). We urge you to follow the steps in the tutorials step by step by entering the R commands in your own RStudio session on your laptop to aquire the hands-on experience. In addtion we have prepared a seperate dataset with exercises and solutions, also to be found under [schedule]().
