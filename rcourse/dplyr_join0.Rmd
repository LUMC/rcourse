> Combine tibbles 

`*_join(...)` is a family of functions for combining two tibbles on common `variable(s)` called `key`.

For example, take a group of people (n=7) for which we have collected age and height data:

```{r}
# height 
df1 <- tibble(name = c("Isa","Jaylinn","Mila","Milas","Yara"),
           height = c(160, 172, 182, 157, 162)) 
df1
# age
df2 <- tibble(name = c("Fiene","Jaylinn","Mila","Noah","Yara"),
           age = c(20,24,17,23,17)) 
df2
```

The information here is incomplete, for some we have only `height` and for some only `age`. Now we want to combine these tibbles into a single table with variables `name`, `age` and `height`. We can do this with a join function which is able to combine observations (rows) by **matching on the common variable(s) between the two tibbles**. Matching is done **by** one or more variables, in this case the variable `name`.

`r info_block("Keep in mind that for a proper joining of data, the matched variable(s), also known as the key, must be unique in both tibbles.")`

## Join : single variable 

You may control the layout of the combined table by choosing one of the three join function laid out below.

### inner_join

Return all rows in `df1` where there are matching values of `name` in `df2` and all columns in both `df1` and `df2`: 

```{r}
inner_join(df1,df2, by = "name")

```

### left_join

Return all rows from `df1` and all columns in both `df1` and `df2`, `NA` for missing values in `df2`:

```{r}
left_join(df1,df2, by = "name")
```


### full_join 

All rows and all columns in `df1` and `df2`.

```{r}
full_join(df1,df2, by = "name")
```


## Join : multiple variables as the key

To illustrate let's split the pulse dataset into two separate tibbles with common variables `name` and `height`: 

```{r}
p1 <- pulse  %>% select(name,height,age,gender,year)
p1
p2 <- pulse  %>% select(-age,-gender,-year)
p2
```

`p1` has the common variables `{name,height}` (the key) and additional variables `{age,gender,year}`, and `p2` has the same key variables `{name,height}` with some other measurement variables such as `pulse1` `pulse2`  etc.


> Is the combination `{name,height}` a valid choice as the unique key to join two tibbles p1 and p2? 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
msg <- "Yes. This because the combination is unique in the table. You can check the uniqueness of {name,height} with the command duplicated, see also ?base::duplicated.  The statement
sum(duplicated(pulse %>% select(name,height)))==0 tests whether the number of duplicates is equal to 0."
qa(msg)
```

Now we want to join them back together using `full_join`: 

```{r}
full_join(p1,p2) # common variables are used when no variable is specified. 
```

It is a **better practice** to explicitly specify the variables: 

```{r} 
pulse_joined <- full_join(p1,p2, by = c("name","height"))
pulse_joined
```

You may check: 

```{r}
all_equal(pulse,pulse_joined) # caution: all_equal is an experimental function
```

`r show_warning(" The function all_equal is an experimental function and may become obsolete! ")`


## Bind tibbles by rows and columns

Often we have different data sets with i) the same set of variables or ii) same set of observations but different variables which we would like to combine: 

- **bind_rows(...)**  function creates a new tibble from a set of tibbles with _not necessarily_ common variables. 
- **bind_cols(...)**  function creates a new tibble from a set of tibbles with common observations. 

> bind_rows

Take for example the following two data sets with common variables name,year and colour:

```{r}
favourite_colour1  <- tibble(name=c("Lucas","Lotte","Noa","Wim"), 
                           year=c(1995,1995,1995,1994), 
                           colour=c("Blue","Green","Yellow","Purple"))
favourite_colour1
favourite_colour2  <- tibble(name=c("Raul", "Isaac"), 
                           year=c(1998,1998), 
                           colour=c("Red", "Green"))
favourite_colour2
```

then the following gives the combined tibble:

```{r}
favourite_colour1_2 <- bind_rows(favourite_colour1, favourite_colour2)
favourite_colour1_2
```


The function `bind_rows` treats tibbles as a collection of _unordered variables_. Let's take the same data as in `favourite_colour2` but change the order of variables year and colour


```{r}
favourite_colour3  <- tibble(name=c("Raul", "Isaac"), 
                           colour=c("Red", "Green"), 
                           year=c(1998,1998))
favourite_colour3
```

then combining `favourite_colour1` and `favourite_colour3` will yield the same results:

```{r}
favourite_colour1_3 <- bind_rows(favourite_colour1, favourite_colour3)
favourite_colour1_3
```

> What about `bind_rows(favourite_colour3, favourite_colour1)`?

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
msg <- "The same dataset except the order of variables are taken from `favourite_colour3`, the first argument to bind_rows."
qa(msg)
``` 

Another consequence of treating tibbles as a collection of _unordered variables_ is that there is no restriction on the given variables in the tibbles, with other words they might be identical sets of variables as was shown in the examples above but not necessarily:

```{r}
favourite_colour4  <- tibble(name=c("Raul", "Isaac"), 
                           colour=c("Red", "Green"), 
                           year=c(1998,1998), 
                           height= c(173, 179))
favourite_colour4
favourite_colour1_4 <- bind_rows(favourite_colour1, favourite_colour4)
favourite_colour1_4
```


> bind_cols

Let us now combine another tibble with variable 'height' for the same set of observations in `favourite_colour1_2`:


```{r}

heights <- tibble(height=c(173, 179, 167, 181 , 173, 184))
heights
bind_cols(favourite_colour1_2,heights)
```

`r info_block("bind_cols expects the same number of obsersavations in each tibble, it is an error otherwise, and you as the user are responsible for the order of observations in each tibble.")`
