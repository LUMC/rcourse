## Prerequisites

Participants must be able to use a laptop/computer capable of running recent 
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). See below for the [Installation section](#Installation).

## Teachers

- **Szymon M. Kie≈Çbasa**, BDS LUMC, (smkielbasa@lumc.nl)
- **Ramin Monajemi**, BDS LUMC, (rmonajemi@lumc.nl)

## What we teach

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source, free environment/language for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a large repository of statistical analysis methods. 

The goal of the course is to teach students how the R language, extended by [tidyverse package](https://www.tidyverse.org), can be used to **build a report with a simple statistical analysis** of data provided in a table. **This is not a statistics course!** The course assumes no prior programming knowledge. Elementary statistics knowledge is necessary to understand examples.

After the course you will be able to:

- Understand and write (`tidyverse`-based) R code.
- Use R to perform statistical analyses of your own data tables.
- Generate reproducible reports from your own data in HTML, PDF or DOC formats.

We will cover the following topics:

- R expressions.
- R data objects: vectors, data frames (tibbles), lists.
- [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for building reproducible reports.
- Data manipulation: filtering, sorting, summarising of a table; joining/merging multiple tables (with [tidyverse/dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [tidyverse/tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)).
- Visualisation: scatter plots, histograms, boxplots (with [tidyverse/ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)).
- R packages: installation and usage.

## Course structure

The course is divided in 7 half-day slots followed by the final exam. The teachers are available for chatting online during all teaching slots.

### The slots #1-#6: practicing

Each half-day slot is split in a few small topics. Each topic will have:

- a short **online (live video) lecture** for introduction/demonstration,
- followed by a **self/group-study practice session** (with *primary exercises* end *extra exercises*) with chat interactions,
- closed by a short **chat question** and **live video answers** session.

The students are asked to **type the commands** being presented and observe their effects (**avoid copy-paste**; own typing is important in order to learn how R responds to mistakes).  

### The slot #7: trial exam

A **trial exam** will be offered during the last (#7) slot. A set of assignments will be provided to be solved in the following 2 hours (proctoring will not be used). After the trial exam there will be a **chat question** and **live video answers** session.


### The exam

```{r,echo=FALSE}
exam <- read_schedule()[["course"]][["exam"]]
```

There will be an exam on **`r exam$date`, `r exam$time`**. The exam will be made available on **`r exam$venue`**. 

To pass the exam the students are requested to prepare a R Markdown document reporting an analysis on a dataset. You will carry out the following steps:

- Create a RStudio project, knit a R Markdown document.
- Read a table which will be provided.
- Show some filtered/summarized content of the table.
- Produce some plots of the data.

It is allowed to use the course (or other) materials during the exam but it is strictly forbidden to communicate with other persons during the exam.

The *lecture* and *primary exercises* material will be sufficient to carry out the exam successfully. 

## Installation

Before the course prepare your computer:

- **Install R**: go to *the R Project for Statistical Computing* (https://www.r-project.org/) and follow the download and installation instructions.
- **Install RStudio**: go to *the RStudio download page* (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), select a version of RStudio appropriate for your laptop, download it and then install. Please check whether you can start RStudio.

Some additional packages are needed for the course.
During the course the participants will learn how to install packages but this process occasionally fails (because e.g.: additional steps are needed in a particular operating system, or there is lack of permissions to access some system directories, or other software is too old, ...).
Resolving installation problems during the course may be impossible, therefore please try to follow the steps below.
In case of failure, please inform the teachers during the first day of the course.

- **install package tidyverse**: Start RStudio. Go to menu `Tools`/`Install Packages...` In the field `Packages` select `tidyverse`. Press `Install`. (Now, a lot of messages will be shown in the `Console` window - wait till it finishes). In the `Console` window type `library( tidyverse )` and press Enter. Some messages might be displayed but when there is no error the installation is completed.
- **install packages needed for R Markdown**: Start RStudio. Go to menu `File`/`New File`/`R markdown...`. A `New R Markdown` window is displayed. Press `OK`. Now, in case of missing R Markdown packages, you will be asked to install them. Finally, you will see an editor window with `Untitled1` header. Put the cursor in that window, then click `Knit`. Some messages might be displayed but when later a window with some text and a plot is shown the installation is completed.
