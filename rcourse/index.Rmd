title: "Using R for data analysis"
---

## Prerequisites

Participants must be able to use a laptop/computer capable of running recent 
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
See the [Installation section](#installation) below for more details.

## Teachers

- **Szymon M. Kie≈Çbasa**, (smkielbasa@lumc.nl)
- **Ramin Monajemi**, (rmonajemi@lumc.nl)
- **Mo Arkani** (m.arkani@lumc.nl)

## Goals

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source, free environment/language for statistical computing and graphics.
It provides a large repository of statistical analysis methods. 

The goal of the course is to teach students how the R language, extended by [`tidyverse` package](https://www.tidyverse.org), can be used to **build a report with a simple statistical analysis** of data provided in a table.
**NOTE: This is not a statistics course!**
The course assumes no prior programming knowledge. 
Elementary statistics knowledge is necessary to understand examples.

After the course you will be able to:

- Use R language expressions.
- Use R to create simple data objects (vectors, lists) and change their content.
- Apply R descriptive statistics functions to data in vectors.
- Use R to read tables (tibbles), filter their rows, select/rename/add columns (with [`tidyverse/dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [`tidyverse/tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)).
- Apply R descriptive statistics functions to summarize data from grouped table rows.
- Use R to create scatter plots (with [`tidyverse/ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)).
- Locate other methods for data manipulation or plotting.
- Locate and install packages extending base R functionality (e.g. advanced statistical methods).
- Explain R factors.
- Use [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to create a reproducible data analysis leading to a report (HTML, PDF, DOC).
- Recognize and explain simple `tidyverse`-based R code written by others.

## Course structure

The course is divided in 4 half-day interactive lectures followed by a 2 hour exam.

### The slots

The topics are split in a number of small sections (a few per a half-day slot) and each section will have:

- A short **online introduction/demonstration**.
- A **self/group-study practice** session (with primary exercises end extra exercises).
- Questions and Answers discussed in an online (live) chat channel.

The students are asked to type the commands being presented and observe their effects (avoid copy-paste; own typing is important in order to learn how R responds to mistakes).

### The exam

There will be an exam. 
Please check the date and the location on the [LUMC Onderwijsrooster/Studenten/Biomedische Wetenschappen/B1R](https://roosters.lumc.nl/WebPlanner/webber/1718_PUBLICATIE/permalink/139c6acbcd7fd78d0574cbdbed82a5ab).

During the exam you will need to prepare an R Markdown document reporting an analysis on a dataset.
You will carry out the following steps:

- Create an RStudio project and an R Markdown document.
- Write R code to read a provided table.
- Write R code to perform simple manipulations/analyses of the table or its columns.
- Write R code to produce some plots of the table data.

During the exam it is allowed to use the course (or other) materials but it is strictly forbidden to communicate with other persons.

The **extra exercises** will **not** be part of the exam. They are elective and may contain more advanced topics.

## Installation

Before the course prepare your computer.  
**NOTE:** Resolving installation problems during the course may be impossible,
therefore please follow the steps below a week before the start of the course.
In case of failure, please inform the teachers. In some situations intervention
of the administrator of your computer might be necessary.

- **Install R**: Go to *the R Project for Statistical Computing* (https://www.r-project.org/) and follow the download and installation instructions.
- **Install RStudio**: Go to *the RStudio download page* (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), select a version of RStudio appropriate for your laptop, download it and then install. Please check whether you can start RStudio.

Some additional packages are needed for the course.
During the course the participants will learn how to install packages but this process occasionally fails (because e.g.: additional steps are needed in a particular operating system, or there is lack of permissions to access some system directories, or other software is too old, ...).

- **Install Rtools** (Windows only!): During installation of some packages you may encounter the following error `Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed`. If that is the case, follow *the Rtools installation* (https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/).
- **Install tidyverse package**: Start RStudio. Go to menu `Tools`/`Install Packages...` In the field `Packages` select `tidyverse`. Press `Install`. (Now, a lot of messages will be shown in the `Console` window - wait till it finishes). In the `Console` window type `library( tidyverse )` and press Enter. Some messages might be displayed but when there is no error the installation is completed.
- **Install packages needed for R Markdown**: Start RStudio. Go to menu `File`/`New File`/`R markdown...`. A `New R Markdown` window is displayed. Press `OK`. Now, in case of missing R Markdown packages, you will be asked to install them. Finally, you will see an editor window with `Untitled1` header. Put the cursor in that window, then click `Knit`. Some messages might be displayed but when later a window with some text and a plot is shown the installation is completed.

During the course applications in multiple windows will be used.
For better experience we advice a setup with two monitors (e.g. laptop and an external monitor).
