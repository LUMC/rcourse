```

## Multitopic exercises

1. *Dynamic plots with plotly*.  
The plots generated by `ggplot2` library are static (simple images).  
`plotly` library allows to produce plots with additional functionality.  
Install the `plotly` package and load `library(plotly)`.  
Next, create a scatter plot (e.g. height vs. weight from pulse data set) and store it in variable `p`.  
Finally, execute `ggplotly( p )` to produce a dynamic plot.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5}
# install.packages( "plotly" )
# library( plotly )

p <- ggplot( pulse ) +
  aes( x = weight, y = height, color = gender, shape = alcohol ) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
p              # this is static ggplot2 image
ggplotly( p )  # this is a ggplot converted by plotly to a dynamic version
```
